**Allows the connection of higher client versions to lower server versions -
it works on any platform you can think of.**

The base ViaVersion jar runs on Paper and Velocity. We also have projects integrating ViaVersion to run
on Fabric, Forge, Bungee, Sponge, or as a standalone proxy to join from basically any client version on
any server version from the past decade. **See [HERE](https://viaversion.com) for an overview of the different Via\* projects.**

Note that ViaVersion will be able to **run best on either Paper servers or through [ViaFabricPlus](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaFabricPlus?tab=readme-ov-file#viafabricplus)** due to having
direct access to client/server state and more extensive API.

Snapshot support
--------
**ViaVersion will only be released a few days *after* a Minecraft update** unless the protocol changes of the update were trivial. If you want early-access, usually days or even weeks before the final release, you can subscribe to either:
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kennytv/sponsorships?sponsor=kennytv&tier_id=385613&preview=false) (preferred option. Use the `/verify` command on this Discord after), or alternatively
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kennytv/membership) (see the highest tier and make sure to link Patreon to your Discord account under Settings->Connections)
  This also includes access to a private repository with the code, which will be pushed to the public repository after the given delay on a Minecraft update.
