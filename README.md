**Allows the connection of 1.9 clients to 1.8**

This plugin modifies netty to allow connection of 1.9 clients to 1.8,

###*Don't use late bind*

This uses our new API, we currently don't have javadocs yet but look at one of our protocols on how to get started then use ProtocolRegistry.registerProtocol()

This took 100s hours of work, so if you enjoy this consider looking into contacting me and supporting my projects.
