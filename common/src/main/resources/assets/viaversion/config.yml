# Easier to configure alternative to 'block-protocols'. Uses readable version strings with possible '<' and '>' prefixes.
# An example to block 1.16.4, everything below 1.16, as well as everything above 1.17.1 would be: ["<1.16", "1.16.4", ">1.17.1"]
# You can use both this and the block-protocols option at the same time as well.

# Velocity allows you to have different server versions inside.

# To get a server's protocol, ViaVersion will do the following:
# Look for the server in the following section, then look for the last ping if velocity-ping is enabled
# otherwise use default.

# You can find protocol ids on https://minecraft.wiki/w/Protocol_version
