# BungeeCord allows you to have different server versions inside.
# Instead of you entering all the versions of these servers, we can ping them.
#
# What interval would you like us to ping at? (in seconds)
# Use -1 to disable.

# If the above is enabled, should we save the info to the config (in the section below)
bungee-ping-save: true
# To get a servers protocol, ViaVersion will do the following:
# Look for the server in the following section, then look for the last ping if bungee-ping is enabled
# otherwise use default.
#
# The format for the following is:
#  servername: protocolversion
# You can find protocol ids on http://wiki.vg/Protocol_version_numbers
# It will fallback to the default option if none found.
