/**
 * Tracks the last Secure Chat state that we received from the client. This is important to always have a valid 'last
 * seen' state that is consistent with future and past updates from the client (which may be signed). This state is
 * used to construct signed command packets to the outdated server from unsigned ones from the modern client.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If we last forwarded a chat or command packet from the client, we have a known 'last seen' that we can
 *     reuse.</li>
 *     <li>If we last forwarded a chat acknowledgement packet, the previous 'last seen' cannot be reused. We
 *     cannot predict an up-to-date 'last seen', as we do not know which messages the client actually saw.</li>
 *     <li>Therefore, we need to hold back any acknowledgement packets so that we can continue to reuse the last valid
 *     'last seen' state.</li>
 *     <li>However, there is a limit to the number of messages that can remain unacknowledged on the server.</li>
 *     <li>To address this, we know that if the client has moved its 'last seen' window far enough, we can fill in the
 *     gap with dummy 'last seen', and it will never be checked.</li>
